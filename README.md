# Number-Conversion
Convert a decimal number to its equivalent binary, octal, and hexadecimal values. 

For this assignment, you will complete problem 5.37 (decimal to binary) and 5.38 (decimal to octal) in
your text plus (decimal to hex). This project will require you to pull together numerous programming
concepts we have covered so far this semester.
1. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a decimal integer and displays its corresponding
binary value, octal value and hex value. For this exercise, we will use 16 bits. DO NOT USE
Javaâ€™s Integer.toBinaryString(int), Integer.toOctalString(int) or Integer.toHexString(int) in this
program. In addition, DO NOT look up these methods to see how they are coded in order to use
that information to help with your solution.
